NEW YORK—Mayor Bill de Blasio and Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Emily Lloyd today announced that all 5,300 buildings that were registered as burning Number 6 heating oil in 2011 have converted to a cleaner fuel as of December 31, 2015 – a key step toward a healthier and more sustainable New York City as the administration works toward its OneNYC goals of an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and the cleanest air of any large U.S. city by 2030.

“Climate change is one of the greatest threats we face – and the most vulnerable New Yorkers are disproportionately impacted,” said Mayor de Blasio. “That's why we’ve challenged ourselves to cut emissions 80 percent by the year 2050, and to achieve the cleanest air of any major U.S. city by 2030. Fully eliminating No. 6 heating oil – the most polluting heating oil – from our buildings is a vital step toward those goals, and we'll continue to move toward renewables and away from fossil fuels.”

No. 6 oil contains the highest level of sulfur of all fuels commonly used for heating, and burning it emits sulfur dioxide and greater amounts of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide than cleaner fuels. Particulate matter can exacerbate cardiovascular and lung disease, and can even lead to premature death. Sulfur and nitrogen dioxide are respiratory irritants that exacerbate lung diseases like asthma, and nitrogen oxides contribute to ozone, another respiratory irritant, in downwind communities.  

The conversion program began under the Bloomberg Administration and as all 5,300 buildings have now switched to a cleaner burning fuel, there has been a substantial reduction in air pollution, which models show will prevent 210 premature deaths and 540 hospitalizations each year/ Neighborhoods with the highest density of boiler conversions – such as northern Manhattan, northern Queens, and the South Bronx – saw the greatest improvement in air quality with the greatest proportion of health benefits occurring in vulnerable, high poverty areas. In addition, the heating oil conversions have reduced citywide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by an estimated 800,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.  

“The use of heavy heating oil was one of the most serious contributors to air pollution in New York City and, with significant input from a variety of stakeholders, we developed sensible regulations that helped 5,300 buildings switch to a cleaner fuel resulting in significantly healthier air for all New Yorkers,” said DEP Commissioner Emily Lloyd. “Under Mayor de Blasio’s leadership, New York City is delivering on our commitment to be a sustainable city and a leader in environmental stewardship.”

“We are delighted that our outreach program succeeded in getting building owners the information and strategies they needed to convert their boilers. Our Clean Heat program has also become a model for new energy outreach programs we are launching, such as the Retrofit Accelerator. No more will New Yorkers have to breathe in clouds of soot coming out of the tops of buildings. We win on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and New Yorkers can breathe better too,” said Nilda Mesa, Director of the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability.

“Promoting a healthy and thriving New York City begins with the quality of the air that we breathe every day,” said Health Commissioner Mary Bassett. “The City’s action to move 5,300 buildings to a cleaner, more sustainable fuel source will have remarkable consequences for the health of families now and in the future.”

“The end of Number 6 oil is fantastic news for New Yorkers,” said Manhattan Borough President Gale A. Brewer.  “As time passes we continue to learn how critical air quality is to public health. We have a moral obligation to make sure our kids grow up breathing cleaner air.”

“This achievement is enormously important, not only for our environment, but also for the health of all New Yorkers,” said Council Member Corey Johnson, Chair of the New York City Council Committee on Health. “As the most populous city in the nation, we need to set a high standard when it comes to building emissions. By eliminating No. 6 oil from our buildings, Mayor de Blasio and DEP are creating a cleaner city, and lives are being saved as a result.  I thank them for their tireless efforts on this crucial issue.”

Council Member Costa Constantinides, Chair of the Council Environmental Protection Committee, said, ""It is heartening to see that all buildings across our city no longer use No. 6 fuel oil, the dirtiest way to heat buildings.  The conversion to cleaner fuel has reduced air pollution, which will prevent premature deaths and hospitalizations.  I will continue to work to ensure that we take even bolder steps and move towards even cleaner fuel oil so that we can meet our goal of reducing our carbon emissions 80 percent by 2050.  I thank DEP Commissioner Emily Lloyd for her leadership on this important issue.""

Marcia Bystryn, President of the New York League of Conservation Voters said: ""Every New Yorker deserves to breathe clean air that is free of pollution.  The end of No. 6 heating oil is a major milestone that will significantly improve air quality.  We applaud the Mayor and DEP for their efforts to reduce emissions and create a greener, healthier city.""

“Environmental Defense Fund is proud to have partnered with Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Department of Environmental Protection on this initiative,” said Abbey Brown, New York City Clean Energy Project Manager at EDF, a national environmental organization headquartered in New York City.  “The tremendous work by NYC Clean Heat and its partners has dramatically improved air quality and building efficiency citywide, and is being expanded through the NYC Retrofit Accelerator.  By helping buildings switch off of No. 6 oil to cleaner fuels, NYC Clean Heat mobilized building owners and managers across the city, resulting in New York’s cleanest air since the early 1960s and serving as a model for cities worldwide.”

“On behalf of all New Yorkers who breathe our air, the American Lung Association commends Commissioner Lloyd, Mayor de Blasio, and the Department of Environmental Protection for seeing this important initiative through,” said Jeff Seyler, President & CEO of the American Lung Association of the Northeast.  “By eliminating the use of No. 6 heating oil, we will see major reductions of pollutants in our air leading to fewer hospitalizations and more lives saved.”

Ground-level air quality surveys taken by the New York City Department of Health in 2008-2009 showed that heavy heating oil was one of the most serious sources of local air pollution in New York City. DEP permits the use of large boilers in the city and almost all use either natural gas, No. 2, No. 4 or No. 6 oil as fuel. Working closely with environmental groups and the real estate industry, in 2011 DEP promulgated new rules which phased out the use of No. 6 heating oil by the end of 2015. Since then, DEP enforcement staff have conducted nearly 4,000 inspections, issued more than 2,000 Notices of Violation and 162 Cease and Desist Orders to ensure buildings were making the required conversion. In addition, the NYC Clean Heat Program helped more than 4,800 of these buildings convert off of No. 6 oil, and nearly 1,000 additional buildings convert off of No. 4 oil, by helping building owners understand their options, navigate the process of completing a conversion, and access financing and incentives to cover the costs. As of July 1, 2015, 96 percent of buildings had made the conversion from No. 6, and all were in compliance with the law by the end of the year.

Additional emission reductions have come from State rules that limited the sulfur content of No. 2 heating oil to 15 parts per million (a 99 percent reduction) and City rules restricting the sulfur content of No. 4 oil to 1,500 parts per million (a 50 percent reduction). DEP also now requires large building boilers to have annual tune-ups and combustion efficiency tests to ensure the boilers meet updated burning efficiency criteria. By increasing an existing boiler’s combustion efficiency from 80 to 83 percent, the New York State standard for new boilers, a building will use thousands of gallons less fuel every year and save tens of thousands of dollars in costs.   

In addition, in 2015 Mayor de Blasio signed into law the most sweeping update to the City’s Air Pollution Control Code in 40 years. The revisions to the Code deleted outdated provisions and focused new standards on pollution sources that have had little or no emissions control requirements, including commercial char broilers, fireplaces, food trucks, and refrigeration vehicles. These sources, viewed as a whole, emit a significant amount of particulate matter. Mayor de Blasio also committed to accelerating the phase out of No. 4 heating oil with the release of OneNYC in April 2015. This is expected to accelerate additional air quality improvements and greenhouse gas reductions.

Building on the success of NYC Clean Heat and DEP’s heating oil regulations, in September 2015, the City launched the NYC Retrofit Accelerator, a one-stop resource to help owners and operators of privately-owned buildings undertake a range of energy and water efficiency upgrades. The Retrofit Accelerator offers a team of efficiency advisors to provide independent, customized advisory services at no cost to building owners to identify energy and water upgrades and navigate the building retrofit process, including financing and incentive options. The Retrofit Accelerator continues the mission of the NYC Clean Heat program by helping building owners convert off of No. 4 heavy heating oil and is a key component of Mayor de Blasio’s commitment to reduce citywide GHG emissions by 80 percent by 2050 (80x50). The NYC Retrofit Accelerator is expected to reduce citywide GHG emissions by almost one million metric tons and save New Yorkers $350 million in utility costs annually by 2025. 

DEP manages New York City’s water supply, providing more than one billion gallons of water each day to more than nine million residents, including eight million in New York City. The water is delivered from a watershed that extends more than 125 miles from the city, comprising 19 reservoirs and three controlled lakes. Approximately 7,000 miles of water mains, tunnels and aqueducts bring water to homes and businesses throughout the five boroughs, and 7,500 miles of sewer lines and 96 pump stations take wastewater to 14 in-city treatment plants. In addition, DEP has a robust capital program, with a planned $14 billion in investments over the next 10 years that will create up to 3,000 construction-related jobs per year.  This capital program is responsible for critical projects like City Water Tunnel No. 3; the Staten Island Bluebelt program, an ecologically sound and cost-effective stormwater management system; the city’s Watershed Protection Program, which protects sensitive lands upstate near the city’s reservoirs in order to maintain their high water quality; and the installation of more than 820,000 Automated Meter Reading devices, which will allow customers to track their daily water use, more easily manage their accounts and be alerted to potential leaks on their properties.

Work is underway on the first phase of a large-scale Energy Performance Contract (EPC), which will reduce annual utility costs by more than $3.5 million and benefit more than 45,000 residents at 16 NYCHA developments citywide.

This is part of a series of EPCs worth $300 million to upgrade and retrofit up to 120,000 apartments, benefiting nearly 262,000 NYCHA residents.


 

NEW YORK––The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), the nation’s largest public housing authority, announced today that work is underway on its first ever large-scale Energy Performance Contract (EPC), which will reduce annual utility costs by more than $3.5 million by improving energy and water efficiency. The $56 million project includes lighting, water conservation and heating upgrades targeting nearly 20,000 apartments at 16 public housing developments in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. These upgrades will benefit more than 45,000 public housing residents and contribute to New York City and NYCHA’s sustainability efforts.

The EPC, facilitated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is part of the Mayor’s sweeping green buildings plan and commitment to an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. New York City is the largest city in the world to make that commitment.

Bomee Jung, NYCHA Vice President of Energy and Sustainability, said, “At a time when NYCHA is facing steep budget cuts and 17 billion dollars in unmet capital needs, these Energy Performance Contracts redirect energy cost savings into energy efficiency upgrades that improve resident quality of life. Every dollar saved will help us preserve and maintain public housing.”

Mirza Orriols, HUD Deputy Regional Administrator for New York and New Jersey, said, ""HUD's Energy Performance Contracts incentivize housing authorities to invest in energy efficiency measures that will make their buildings greener and healthier for residents. These forward-looking investments by NYCHA, financed entirely through public-private partnerships, will ultimately save taxpayer dollars.""

Mark Chambers, Director of the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability, said, “As the largest public housing authority in North America, NYCHA represents a unique opportunity to scale up reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across its portfolio of buildings. The launch of this first phase of the EPC is a critical step forward in improving the energy efficiency of our buildings for all New Yorkers while cutting costs for residents, and is a key element in delivering on our ambitious OneNYC goal of reducing the city’s greenhouse gases 80 percent by 2050. I applaud NYCHA for their commitment to sustainability and look forward to continued collaboration.”

Jainey Bavisihi, Director of the Mayor’s Office of Recovery & Resiliency, said, “NYCHA residents witnessed some of the worst impacts from Hurricane Sandy, and demonstrated the best of our city in its aftermath. “In the years since, NYCHA has consistently demonstrated leadership and vision in reimaging a stronger and more inclusive NYC. The progress they announced today to improve energy efficiency and reduce costs across their building portfolio illustrates those innovative efforts to deliver  inclusive climate solutions, and  in doing so, help the City chart a course toward a more just, resilient, and sustainable city that is better equipped to withstand the existential threats we face from climate change.”

NYCHA, which received HUD approval for its first large-scale EPC in December 2016, has 4 EPCs in the works worth approximately $300 million, representing the largest energy savings program for any public housing authority. Together, they will enable NYCHA to upgrade 120,000 apartments at up to 130 developments, or 67 percent of the Authority’s building portfolio, benefiting nearly 262,000 residents.

The benefit of an EPC is that it enables housing authorities to achieve energy and water savings without having to provide up-front capital dollars. In an EPC, a private lender provides construction funds for the installation of these measures and the debt is repaid by the utility savings generated by the work over a period of up to 20 years. This project will generate more than $3.5 million in annual electricity cost savings, which NYCHA will use to repay the 20-year loan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who financed the $56 million in construction funds. The Authority selected Ameresco, Inc.  as the performance contractor, or Energy Service Company (ESCo) to install the efficiency measures.

David J. Anderson, Executive Vice President of Ameresco, said, “Ameresco is pleased to continue our relationship with NYCHA as a key energy services partner for the City’s and NYCHA’s NextGen initiative. This first phase will also provide employment opportunities for NYCHA residents as well as local businesses, thereby contributing to construction jobs that remain in the community.  This entire initiative will improve efficiency as well as resident security and comfort while supporting NYCHA’s sustainability goals.”

Chris Giuliano, head of Energy Services Finance for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said, “As one of the leading providers of energy efficiency financial products in the United States, we are delighted to be able to continue to support the New York City Housing Authority’s energy efficiency initiative. Energy efficiency is a key business focus and an important part of Bank of America’s $125 billion environmental business commitment to address climate change and demands on natural resources.”

The scope of work for this first EPC includes apartment and common area lighting upgrades – replacing less efficient compact fluorescent bulbs and fixtures with light-emitting diode (LED) lights; the installation of water-conserving fixtures such as aerators and showerheads, and comprehensive heating upgrades at Whitman Houses, including boiler room replacement.

Lighting upgrades are currently underway at the first of 16 developments (see list below) and all work is expected to be complete by the summer of 2018.  Heating upgrades at Whitman Houses will begin this summer.

NYCHA is committed to providing job-training and connections to career opportunities. Young residents who have graduated from the Green City Force (GCF) program will be hired to assist in the first phase of apartment lighting upgrades, which includes replacing all interior light bulbs with LED bulbs. GCF is a nonprofit organization that empowers and trains NYCHA residents between the ages of 18-24 year for green sector jobs. GCF Corps members learn about energy efficiency and weatherization up close by serving their communities.

Fifteen residents are already working on the project, and as work progresses over the next 12 months, the contractor will hire more residents through Section 3, a federal mandate that requires employment and other economic opportunities generated by federal assistance to public housing authorities be directed, whenever possible, to public housing residents and other low- and very-low-income individuals.  Additionally, the contractor will hire residents for outreach and education on the benefits of the energy efficiency measures that will be installed.

Geraldine Hopper, Resident Association President at Clason Point Gardens, said, “I am so happy with this initiative. These lights are much brighter and safer. It’s a tremendous difference. You can see better and it’s easier to move around. This will improve the quality of life of residents, especially the seniors.”

Linda Taylor, Resident at Clason Point Gardens, said, “I love how brighter they are, and they look better. You say they are more efficient? Well, that’s just great!”

The energy savings resulting from this project will contribute to the greenhouse gas emission-reduction goals of the NYC Carbon Challenge and OneNYC, as well as HUD’s Better Buildings Challenge.  This project will reduce NYCHA’s annual CO2 emissions by 15,665 tons, which is equivalent to taking 2,603 cars off the road.

Since the release of NYCHA’s comprehensive Sustainability Agenda last year, the Authority has been working with government and private sector partners to provide better service for residents, reduce energy and costs, and curb the effects of climate change. In addition to the EPCs, work is underway to upgrade heating, hot water, interior and exterior lighting, and ventilation systems in buildings across the city through various energy programs.

Council Member Ritchie Torres, Chair of the Committee on Public Housing, said, ""These conservation and sustainability efforts to reduce utility costs are much needed and are innovative ways to improve living standards. I look forward to more progress being made on sustainability and energy usage in public housing as more EPCs are initiated.”

Council Member Jumaane D. Williams, Chair of Committee on Housings and Buildings, said, “Improving energy efficiency is a significant component in working toward the City’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. Not only will it reduce our carbon footprint, but it will also save millions of dollars in utility costs.  I applaud the Administration for making environmental sustainability and energy conservation a priority.”

Council Member James Vacca, said, “I'm encouraged that NYCHA is taking a proactive approach in dealing with energy consumption. It's critical that we do everything we can do to reduce our carbon footprint. By going forward with this EPC, NYCHA is utilizing a public-private partnership to come up with a novel method to save energy and reduce costs. I'm glad that NYCHA is looking towards innovative solutions to solve problems and make NYCHA a better place for everyone.""

State Senator Daniel Squadron said, ""Increased energy efficiency brings benefits for NYCHA's tenants, its future, and our planet. This is a positive step for Vladeck Houses in my district, and NYCHA developments citywide -- I look forward to continuing to partner with NYCHA and community members. Thank you to NYCHA, HUD, the City, Vladeck Houses TA, and my colleagues in government.""

State Assembly Member Walter T. Mosley said, “I applaud New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) for their Energy Performance Contract (EPC) initiative.  This bold program addresses the need to reduce our carbon output and it is vital to preserving the precious green spaces here in the city. The Energy Performance Contract will also help to reduce the cost of energy production which is important in the face of proposed federal cuts. I pledge to continue to work with NYCHA and state officials to ensure the preservation of our public housing stock for the next generation.”

NEW YORK––The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) announced today the completion of a $16.3 million energy-efficiency lighting installation project at 18 public housing developments in Brooklyn, benefitting more than 36,000 public housing residents. This project will generate approximately $1.6 million in annual electricity cost savings for NYCHA and help keep electrical service reliable for residents at times of high demand, especially in the upcoming summer months when electricity demand is at its highest.

“As part of our NextGeneration NYCHA long-term strategic plan, we are committed to attracting investments for capital improvements that generate savings and improve the quality of life of our residents,” said Bomee Jung, NYCHA Vice President of Energy and Sustainability. “This partnership with Con Edison delivers on that promise, while contributing to better service in many Brooklyn neighborhoods surrounding NYCHA developments.”

 “NYCHA’s project shows how a simple lighting change can make a big difference in a customer’s energy costs,” said Vicki Kuo, Director of Energy Efficiency and Demand Management programs at Con Edison. “We look forward to more energy-saving projects with customers in these fast-growing areas helping us keep service reliable.”

Lighting upgrades included replacing less-efficient compact fluorescent or incandescent bulbs in apartments, lobbies, hallways and stairwells, with more energy-efficient light-emitting diode (LED) lights, which can last up to 25,000 hours or nearly 23 years.

This project is part of Con Edison’s Neighborhood Program, which aims to reduce the demand for power in fast-growing neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens during peak hours – the times of highest electricity use over the course of the day. Con Edison contributed $5.6 million to cover a portion of the lighting installation costs in order to reduce peak energy demand in the area by 1.5 megawatts (MW) by May 2017. NYCHA has exceeded that goal by 8 percent or  115.25 kilowatts (kW).

This is the first phase of a two-year effort that will leverage a total of $8.2 million in Neighborhood Program funding to generate a total electric demand reduction of 2.4 MW by May 2018. The second phase, which includes 23 developments in Brooklyn, is anticipated to start by September of this year.

NYCHA will use the approximately $1.6 million in annual electricity cost savings generated by this project to  fund additional energy retrofits such as heating and hot water upgrades at additional developments. The energy savings resulting from this project will also contribute to the greenhouse gas emission-reduction goals of the NYC Carbon Challenge and OneNYC.  This project will reduce NYCHA’s annual CO2 emissions by 6,563 tons, which is equivalent to taking 1,253 cars off the road.

""I am satisfied with the improvements and reforms to several housing developments in my district providing substantial upgrades that benefit our residents' utility accommodations,” said Council Member Darlene Mealy. “The cost efficiency incentive and strategy on behalf of NYCHA results in a win-win situation for all parties involved.""

“I am thrilled to learn that new lighting was installed for many of my Housing Authority residents and others throughout the City. Brighter lighting means safer and better,” said State Assembly Member Joe Lentol.  Plus, to know that it saves money and energy for the entire City makes this good news all around.”

Since the release of NYCHA’s comprehensive Sustainability Agenda last year, the Authority has been working with government and private sector partners to provide better service for residents, reduce energy and costs, and curb the effects of climate change. In addition to the Brooklyn Queens Neighborhood Program, work is underway to heating, hot water, interior and exterior lighting, and ventilation systems in buildings across the city through a series of large-scale Energy Performance Contracts and other energy programs.

Con Edison is investing a total of $200 million in the Neighborhood Program, which offers incentives for residential and business owners, to reduce energy demand by 52 megawatts (MW) –– 41 MW from customer-side solutions and 11 MW from utility-side solutions –– by the summer of 2018. This will help reduce stress on the electrical grid, and defer the construction of a $1.2 billion power substation. The Neighborhood Program supports New York State’s Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiative.

The $104.6 million project is NYCHA’s fourth since 2015 and the Authority’s largest Energy Performance Contract (EPC) to date. It will upgrade heating, lighting, building ventilation systems, and water conservation at 15 developments comprising 15,000 apartments

This project will save NYCHA $154.6 million in energy and water costs over the 18-year financing term, and reduce energy use by 21 percent, advancing NYCHA’s Sustainability Agenda goal of 20 percent energy use reduction by 2026.

NEW YORK – The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) announced today that it is commencing work with Ameresco, Inc. on an Energy Performance Contract (EPC) valued at $104.6 million.

The project is the fourth and largest to date in NYCHA’s series of large-scale EPCs under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s EPC program, as well as the largest HUD has ever approved. It will mean almost 15,000 homes in 15 NYCHA developments across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens will see upgrades in heating, lighting, and building ventilation systems, as well as water conservation.

Undertaken as part of NYCHA’s initiative to improve quality of life and energy efficiency across its portfolio, the project furthers NYCHA’s NextGeneration Sustainability Agenda goals of raising $300 million in EPC financing and reducing energy use by 20 percent by 2026.

This new Energy Performance Contract ensures both that our residents can see necessary improvements to their quality of life and that NYCHA continues to invest in a more sustainable future,” said NYCHA General Manager Vito Mustaciuolo. “This program and the upgrades that follow are vital to ensure we can address our critical infrastructure needs head on.

We are delighted to continue to expand our long-standing public-private partnership with NYCHA,” said David J. Anderson, Executive Vice President and Director of Ameresco. “As a leading energy services provider, we are proud to deliver this $100 million project, which is the largest in the history of HUD’s EPC Program. At over 20 percent energy savings across the 15-site portfolio, this project will significantly contribute to NYCHA’s NextGen Initiative and New York City’s One City Built to Last sustainability goals. I applaud NYCHA for its continued commitment to improving the living standards for its residents by making energy conservation and sustainability a priority.”

As with the three prior EPC projects undertaken by NYCHA since late 2015, the primary goal of the project is to upgrade and modernize heating systems to deliver more consistent and comfortable heat. The scope of work includes:

a new boiler plant at Patterson Houses;
modernized heating distribution controls at 15 developments;
interior light‐emitting diode (LED) lighting and water conservation devices installed throughout the developments; and
new domestic hot water systems and building ventilation improvements.
NYCHA also remains committed to providing job‐training and connections to career opportunities. NYCHA residents who have graduated from Green City Force (GCF), an AmeriCorps program engaging NYCHA youth in service, training, academics, and work experiences related to the clean energy economy, will be hired to install water conservation upgrades and replace all interior light bulbs with LED bulbs. Ameresco and its contractors are required to meet HUD Section 3 and NYCHA Resident Employment Program requirements throughout the EPC.

Once construction is complete, the entire project is expected to save NYCHA 23.5 percent of its fuel consumption, resulting in an average annual cost savings of $8.6 million. Overall, NYCHA’s EPC program has so far resulted in four projects totaling $271.8 million to date, which affect more than 60,000 apartments and 144,000 residents in 72 developments.

“With this EPC, NYCHA has reached $271.8 million toward our $300 million goal for 2025, and we will continue to pursue EPCs aggressively well past the $300 million mark,” said Bomee Jung, NYCHA Vice President of Energy and Sustainability. “Funding for capital improvements is always precious and EPCs provide additional funds above and beyond City, State, and HUD capital.”

Since the 2016 release of NYCHA’s Sustainability Agenda, the Authority has been working with government and private sector partners to provide better services for residents, reduce energy use and costs, and curb the effects of climate change. In addition to the EPCs, work is underway to upgrade heating, hot water, interior and exterior lighting, and ventilation systems in buildings across the city through various energy programs. NYCHA has also been working with HUD on these large-scale EPCs in a program to raise $300 million in private capital, representing the largest energy savings program for any public housing authority. These combined efforts will enable NYCHA to upgrade 120,000 apartments at up to 130 developments, or 67 percent of the Authority’s building portfolio, benefiting nearly 262,000 residents.

https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/showcase-projects/new-york-city-housing-authority-344-east-28th-street,"NEW YORK CITY HOUSING AUTHORITY: 344 EAST 28TH STREET
BACKGROUND
344 East 28th Street is a 26-story residential building located in Manhattan’s Kips Bay neighborhood. Constructed in 1971, the building has 225 units ranging in size from 1 to 4 bedrooms, and serves 450 low- and extremely-low-income residents. 344 East 28th Street, where the average monthly rent is $442, is a critical affordable housing resource for the Kips Bay neighborhood, where the 2010-2014 median rent was $2,131, and 61.8 percent of low-income families are severely rent-burdened (rents of 50 percent or more of income).

Before the retrofit project, the building used 28 percent more energy than the typical New York City multifamily building. Like most New York City multifamily buildings, the primary energy challenge for 344 East 28th Street is in conserving energy used for heat and hot water. Its heating EUI was comparable to NYC 2-pipe steam buildings, and was substantially better than the NYCHA median. However, the building’s hot water-to-heat ratio was almost 50:50, which indicated that the hot water generation was likely extremely inefficient.

SOLUTIONS
NYCHA used a combination of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds and a New York City capital grant to undertake a $2.2 million lighting, heating, and hot-water modernization project, completed in 2012. NYCHA achieved a 55 percent reduction in the energy needed for heating domestic hot water by installing a ground source heat pump (GSHP) system, capturing waste heat in the steam condensate, and by replacing hot water tanks with instantaneous hot water heaters. The GSHP system consists of two 20-ton glycol ground source units and two 2,000-gallon cement-lined domestic hot water storage tanks. Cold water (50°F) from the City’s supply is heated by the GSHP system to 80°-90°F, and then the instantaneous on-demand heater uses district steam to bring the supply temperature to 120°F for distribution to the apartments.

OTHER BENEFITS
The ARRA project at 344 East 28th Street stands out among recent energy efficiency projects as much for its surgical targeting of the primary source of energy waste (inefficient domestic hot water) as for NYCHA’s first (and as of 2017, only) deployment of a renewable technology.

New hot water system
An example of a new hot water system.
As part of NYCHA’s Energy Performance Contact (EPC) program, $104.6 million in upgrades are coming to 15 developments in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, home to 15,000 families. In partnership with Ameresco, an energy services provider, NYCHA will upgrade heating, lighting, and building ventilation systems and implement water conservation measures at these developments. Over 18 years, the project will save NYCHA $154.6 million in energy and water costs and reduce energy use by 21 percent.

The project is the fourth, and largest to date, in NYCHA’s series of EPCs, as well as the largest EPC ever approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which created the program.

“This new Energy Performance Contract ensures both that our residents can see necessary improvements to their quality of life and that NYCHA continues to invest in a more sustainable future,” said NYCHA General Manager Vito Mustaciuolo. “This program, and the upgrades that follow, are vital to ensure we can address our critical infrastructure needs head-on.”

The primary goal of NYCHA’s EPCs is to upgrade and modernize heating systems to deliver more consistent and comfortable heat to residents. The latest EPC involves:

A new boiler plant at Patterson Houses;
Modernized heating distribution controls at 15 developments;
Interior LED lighting and water conservation devices at the developments; and
New hot water systems and building ventilation improvements.
Graduates of Green City Force, which prepares NYCHA youth for “green-collar” careers through training and work experience, will be hired to install the water conservation upgrades and replace all interior light bulbs with LED bulbs.

As part of its Sustainability Agenda, NYCHA aims to generate $300 million in EPCs and reduce energy use by 20 percent Authority-wide by the year 2026.

“With this EPC, NYCHA has reached $271.8 million toward our $300 million goal for 2025, and we will continue to pursue EPCs aggressively, well past the $300 million mark,” noted NYCHA’s Vice President of Energy and Sustainability Bomee Jung. “Funding for capital improvements is always precious, and EPCs provide additional funds above and beyond City, State, and federal capital.”

Altogether, NYCHA’s various energy-efficiency programs will provide upgrades at up to 130 developments, benefitting nearly 262,000 residents.

New roofs, brickwork, boiler systems and construction will improve 16 developments that house 36,000 NYCHA residents

The New York City Housing Authority has begun $69 million in capital improvements beginning in October 2012 at 16 developments, which will result in repairs to roofs, boiler systems, bathrooms and other upgrades for more than 36,000 NYCHA residents over the next six months. The work is part of the NYCHA’s 2012 Capital Plan and is funded by the federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) capital grants. Ongoing renovations to both the interior and exterior of NYCHA buildings and apartments are needed to keep them structurally sound and in a state of good repair.

“Despite a 35 percent drop in federal funding, NYCHA continues to spend its money wisely, on time- and in the best interests of residents,"" said NYCHA Chairman John B. Rhea. “Major upgrades are needed regularly to ensure that heating, plumbing, and other systems continue to function properly, especially since NYCHA buildings are aging structures – 70 percent of our buildings are more than 40 years old.”

Work underway includes:

Replacement of boilers at the Edenwald Houses in the Bronx using nearly $5 million in capital funds;
Exterior brickwork at Red Hook East Houses in Brooklyn with $6 million in capital funds;
Electrical service upgrade at the Douglass Houses in Manhattan using nearly $16 million in capital funds;
Beginning replacement of underground steam lines at the Riis and Elliot-Chelsea Houses in Manhattan using nearly $12 million in capital funds.
Other capital projects beginning in 2012 include bathroom renovations at the Taft Houses ($1.2 million); and elevator rehabilitation/modernization at Breukelen Houses ($7.5 million).
Chairman Rhea also outlined a proposal last month at an Association for a Better New York breakfast in September to utilize $500 million from a proposed capital fund bond issued under HUD’s Capital Fund Financing Program in 2013. This would pay for desperately needed, comprehensively executed roof and brickwork repairs over the next 12 to 36 months. Another benefit will be improved resident safety through the elimination of miles of sidewalk sheds (scaffolding), which is not only unsightly, but also often imposing and ominous. Complete roof replacement, together with facade work, brickwork, and parapet reconstruction, is planned at approximately 350 buildings in over 40 developments in all five boroughs with plans to begin in 2013.

NYCHA is also implementing a Capital Plan to obligate its annual federal funding for Capital Projects in 18 months, as opposed to currently HUD mandated 24 months and also attain its expenditures targets for those projects in 36 months as opposed to currently HUD mandated 48-months. Enhancements to NYCHA’s current planning and process management practices are underway to facilitate these new targeted timelines.

NYCHA has consistently met all HUD mandated guidelines for obligating and spending capital funds. Over the past three years, the agency has made more than $1.5 billion in capital investments – including $423million in federal Stimulus funding for capital improvements that enhanced the quality of life for 140,000 families. Capital projects are selected for inclusion in the agency’s 5-year capital plan based upon information from NYCHA’s physical needs assessment (PNA), in-house design staff, and requests from NYCHA’s Property Management Department, among others. This is an ongoing process of data collection and analysis, and NYCHA updates its 5-year capital plan and prioritizes the available funds annually.

Authority Releases Request for Proposals for New Resilient, Energy Efficient On-Campus Heat, Power & Delivery System to Serve Nearly 6,300 Residents
NEW YORK – The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) today announced a Request for Proposals for a potential project developer to finance, design, construct, and operate a campus-scale heat, hot water, and electricity generation and delivery network for Red Hook Houses East and West. The Authority is seeking combined heat and power generation proposals that would serve 28 buildings spanning 39 acres in Red Hook, and replace the eight steam plants that were destroyed by Hurricane Sandy.

“As part of NYCHA’s Sandy Recovery program, we are working to build back stronger and more resilient than ever before,” said NYCHA Chair and CEO Shola Olatoye.  “A new resilient energy system at Red Hook Houses will ensure that more than 6,000 residents – many of them seniors and children – are protected in the future.”
 
This project is a key resiliency initiative and advances the goals of Mayor de Blasio’s sweeping energy-efficiency and greenhouse gas emission-reduction plan One City: Built to Last, and One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City, his plan for growth, sustainability, resiliency, and equity. It also helps achieve NYCHA’s 10-year sustainability commitments outlined in the NextGeneration NYCHA Sustainability Agenda, released in April 2016.

 “Hurricane Sandy vividly highlighted the need to prepare for the impacts of climate change on our city’s most vulnerable residents,” said Daniel Zarrilli, Senior Director for Climate Policy and Programs and Chief Resilience Officer, Office of the Mayor. “The Red Hook Houses microgrid project is an important program that will expand NYCHA’s energy resiliency and support the Mayor’s OneNYC commitment to making our neighborhoods more equitable, more sustainable, and more resilient.”
 
“Installing a cogeneration and district energy system is one of the most efficient ways in NYC to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring a stable power supply,” said Nilda Mesa, Director of the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability. “NYCHA will be harnessing the energy produced in multiple ways, and eliminating individual building systems, which is a smart way to set up a system that will be better to maintain and control. This new system will cut costs while cutting carbon, and can be a model for public housing nationwide.”

Hurricane Sandy caused significant damage to the boiler plants, as well as the mechanical and electrical systems at Red Hook Houses due to flooding in the basements, affecting heat, hot water and power service.

A district energy system generates and distributes steam, hot water, and electricity to multiple buildings from a central plant. The Red Hook Houses District Energy System will be comprised of two central generation plants, which will be housed in a floodproofed building; two heat and power distribution networks, including a medium pressure steam distribution network and a medium voltage electrical distribution network; and backup generators.

This RFP also builds on the Red Hook Microgrid Feasibility Study commissioned by the New York Power Authority, and anticipates a future Red Hook Community Microgrid, currently under design by Brooklyn Community Board 6 and Red Hook NY Rising Committee. A microgrid is an electrical network serving a small geographic area that has its own means of generating electricity and can be disconnected from the electrical grid when necessary. NYCHA’s microgrid will be comprised of two medium voltage electrical networks to serve all 28 buildings at Red Hook Houses East and West. These networks will be independent from the main grid, and capable of future interconnection to the nearby Red Hook Community Microgrid project.

""The courage demonstrated by the residents of Red Hook persevering through Superstorm Sandy shone as a light in the darkness,"" said Brooklyn Borough President Eric L. Adams. ""A new cogeneration system will help sustain that light, keeping the families at Red Hook Houses safe when disaster strikes and protecting their access to critical resources such as electricity, heat, and hot water. The reduction in carbon emissions as a result of this sustainability plan will also contribute to our efforts to fight future natural disasters that threaten Brooklyn’s waterfront.""

 “Ensuring NYCHA facilities are more resilient has become an increasingly critical priority since Sandy. That’s why I worked to deliver federal resources throughout New York to build back NYCHA developments stronger than before,” said Representative Nydia M. Velázquez. “This most recent project will ensure thousands of Red Hook families can access heat, power and hot water in the event of future storms and I’m pleased it is moving forward.”

""NYCHA must become more energy efficient and committed to sustainability and resiliency in the Red Hook Houses,” said New York State Assembly Assistant Speaker Felix Ortiz. “This new program should help eliminate the power outages that have happened too often in past years. Our residents’ safety and quality of life always comes first.""

""Red Hook residents and businesses have long suffered from frequent power outages. They hit our community particularly hard on NYCHA Red Hook East and West properties,” said Council Member Carlos Menchaca. “This request for proposals for a cogeneration and microgrid energy system is promising. It aligns with the resilience planning Red Hook residents have been conducting. I am hopeful that NYCHA will build reliable and sustainable energy systems that prevent outages in Red Hook.""

""We're thrilled that Red Hook Houses will be able to operate under their own steam and look forward to continuing to work with NYCHA to ensure that this state-of-the-art system can supply power to the broader Red Hook neighborhood in the event of a future catastrophe,"" said Craig R. Hammerman, District Manager for Brooklyn Community Board 6.

“There is great potential for a Red Hook Community Microgrid to create not only a more reliable emergency power system for our community but also to spearhead a model example of how communities can be involved,” said Gita Nandan, chair, Red Hook New York Rising Community Reconstruction Planning Committee. “We are thrilled that NYCHA has taken this project to heart and is embarking on the first step to make Red Hook East and West more resilient.”

“At Red Hook Initiative we are extremely excited about NYCHA's commitment to a cogeneration system and microgrid in the Red Hook Houses,” said Jill Eisenhard, Executive Director of Red Hook Initiative. “This response ensures that residents will be getting the housing infrastructure that they need and deserve and that community needs are being heard. Red Hook will now have the tools and resources necessary for improved resiliency and sustainability. “

A pre-proposal conference will be held on June 29, at 1pm at 250 Broadway, 12th Floor. Proposal submissions will be divided into two parts to provide applicants with sufficient time to develop and elaborate on their proposals. The deadline for submitting Part 1 is July 22 and the deadline for submitting Part 2 is September 9.

Announcement is One of the Largest Ever Allocations Feds are Making for Public Housing; Deal Will Allow NYCHA to Replace Costly Temporary Boilers that Serve 110 Buildings, Well Before Current 2016 Timeline


Normally FEMA Will Repair, Not Replace, Ancient or Damaged Boilers – Negotiations Over Replacement Process Greatly Slowed Down Any Progress, Depriving Thousands of NYCHA Residents Of More Robust and Reliable Permanent Source for Hot Water and Heat


New Agreement Will Allow NYCHA to Commence Work Sooner and Guarantee Sufficient Funds to Complete the Jobs – Since FEMA Will Accept NYCHA Estimates and Not Negotiate Down -- Allow for Brand New, State-of- the-Art Boilers, and Full Reimbursement to NYC

On Monday, U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a major step forward in Superstorm Sandy recovery for thousands of New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) residents currently living in buildings with temporary boiler systems. After prolonged negotiations, Schumer secured a commitment from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that they would provide funding for NYCHA to install new, state-of-the-art boilers to replace those damaged by the storm. Sixty boilers were damaged, and since then NYCHA has been utilizing temporary and costly boiler systems. In total, the boilers serve 110 separate residential buildings in Coney Island, Rockaway and the Lower East Side, affecting 8,862 units.

Since the storm, NYCHA has been spending $3 million per month for the temporary boilers, greatly taxing the already financially strapped agency. Normally FEMA will try to repair rather than replace damaged infrastructure and then subsequently negotiate the cost. Schumer and de Blasio announced that FEMA has agreed not to challenge NYCHA’s repair cost estimates and will pay for brand new boilers, rather than just repair the damaged ones. This will greatly speed up the process of restoring normal service to the buildings impacted by the storm, which originally hadn't been scheduled to be completed until 2016. Under the new agreement, FEMA and NYCHA are seeking to have the final funding agreement in place early this year so boiler replacement can start later this year.

""For more than 16 months, bureaucratic infighting and red tape have denied NYCHA residents the most basic of necessities -- reliable heat and hot water,"" said Schumer. ""Today we're firmly on the path to righting a wrong that has too often left NYCHA residents in the cold during the winter and in the dark at night. Mayor de Blasio and his team have been working hard with me on ending this unnecessary delay, and I want to thank them for their assistance.""


""When Superstorm Sandy made landfall nearly a year and a half ago, it brought with it death, tragedy and destruction. Too often the wait for relief and recovery has exacerbated the tragedy of the storm -- a reality NYCHA residents know all too well,” said Mayor de Blasio. “Now, thanks in large part to the leadership of Senator Schumer, we will much sooner than planned start making the upgrades needed to improve the quality of life for thousands in public housing whose lives are still disrupted by Sandy. These replacement boilers will bring not only reliable hot water and heat water to so many, but essential peace-of-mind.""

""On behalf of the more than 400,000 New Yorkers that call NYCHA home, I want to thank Senator Schumer and Mayor de Blasio for their tireless commitment and leadership,” said NYCHA Chair Shola Olatoye. “NYCHA has been working aggressively for a year to tap the financial resources needed to restore our Sandy-damaged buildings. Thank you to our FEMA colleagues for engaging in negotiations and making the commitment to secure the recovery funding we need to begin the work necessary to bring these buildings—these homes—damaged by Sandy up to a state of repair and resiliency.”

Since Superstorm Sandy, sixty boiler systems serving 110 NYCHA buildings have been in a state of disrepair. NYCHA has been spending $3 million per month on temporary boilers. Overall, NYCHA has spent approximately $56 million for 24 temporary boilers at 16 developments. The boilers are in place to provide a replacement to boiler rooms that heat multiple buildings; each mobile boiler is working in place of multiple boilers.

To overcome the bureaucratic hurdles, Schumer organized a sit down meeting with top officials from FEMA and NYCHA, including NYCHA Chairwoman Shola Olatoye, in Washington, D.C. to hammer out a clear path forward. The meeting resulted in an agreement that ultimately cuts through the red tape that had been preventing the funding agreement, and paves the way to expedite boiler replacement for thousands of NYCHA residents.

The agreement is as follows:
1. FEMA has agreed to pay for NYCHA’s cost estimates for boiler replacement so long as they are provided by independent licensed engineers.
2. FEMA will provide full replacement for the boilers, as opposed to repair, provided they meet one of the necessary criteria. The criteria include: boilers have suffered saltwater inundation, boilers are so old that even if repaired they cannot meet current codes or cost of repair is above fifty percent of the cost of replacing the boilers.
3. FEMA has agreed to reimburse NYCHA for the cost of the temporary boilers thus far, relieving the cash strapped agency of additional debt.
4. FEMA will seek to have a funding agreement hammered out and signed early this year, allowing boiler replacement to begin later this year, ahead of the currently projected 2016 start date.

Schumer also previously announced he was pushing New York City’s separate application to FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant program (HMGP). Schumer is pushing for $175 million in federal funding to raise boilers, backup generators and change the way several NYCHA complexes receive their heat and electricity. Schumer today said that he expects NYCHA to receive some type of mitigation funding to raise boilers out of the flood zone.",1,chuck pushed for new boiler funding
https://citylimits.org/2019/10/23/climate-control-is-a-year-round-issue-at-nycha-especially-for-seniors/,"A mid-October afternoon at the Castle Hill Senior Center in the Bronx.

As winter approaches, advocates for New York City Housing Authority tenants are fixing their attention on the many boiler repairs that need to be made to prevent the rampant heat outages that plagued 87 percent of its buildings last year.

But some NYCHA senior centers have barely just recovered from a summer defined by multiple heat waves and absent repair teams. And the problems that plagued the system’s Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioner (HVAC) systems this summer could repeat over the winter, as those systems are changed over to heating.


NYCHA employs only one repair company, called Hi Tech, to service HVAC repairs in all five boroughs. Some NYCHA senior center directors, who waited weeks or months for repairs, say that company’s staff is stretched thin as a result.

During a September 19th hearing of the City Council’s Aging Committee, the disproportionate impact of these heat and cold emergencies on NYCHA’s seniors was addressed, as was their likely increasing frequency as climate change continues.

“Given the impact of climate change, we all … agree that it may become more frequent in the future,” Chair Margaret Chin said at the hearing.

A pervasive issue

HVAC problems are not solely a NYCHA issue – they are pervasive at many of the city’s senior centers, including the centers in NYCHA’s portfolio and others, according to testimony at September’s hearing.

“Many senior centers could probably tell you that HVAC is just barely hanging on. It’s very likely that there could be a crisis soon,” Katelyn Andrews from the nonprofit LiveOn NY testified.

SPECIAL REPORT: EXTREME HEAT
Watch and read a special City Limits-BRIC report on the heat risks facing the city.

At NYCHA’s senior centers, attendees are reliant on the housing authority to handle repairs. These issues have been felt at the NYCHA Castle Hill Senior Center, in the Bronx, where NYCHA was unable to fix the center’s HVAC system for most of the summer.

“They never got it together,” says Castle Hill director Emily Pelayo, who says she raised the issue with NYCHA continually before repairs were made. She says the breakdowns have been happening every summer and winter for four years.

The center sees attendance of about 125 people on a good day, about 65 in a lull, according to Pelayo. About 97 percent of people using the center live in the adjacent Castle Hill NYCHA development.

In an e-mail, NYCHA said the HVAC cooling repairs at Castle Hill were completed September 9, 2019. The HVAC was turned over for heat on October 3rd and repairs to that system are “expected to be complete by 10/25/2019.” NYCHA says the heat is currently operational while those repairs are being made.

On a visit by City Limits on October 15, a date when temperatures in New York City reached an unseasonably warm 61 degrees Fahrenheit , several rooms at Castle Hill’s center were sweltering hot. A large upstairs gymnasium used for dance classes and other activities felt as though it were 80 degrees.

Pelayo says NYCHA provided the center with a number of smaller, portable air conditioners over the summer as a temporary fix while they waited on the HVAC repair.

The one NYCHA vendor who works on HVAC repair in all five boroughs, Hi Tech, has two contracts; one for chiller units and one for condenser units, a NYCHA spokesperson said.

The use of one contractor strikes Pelayo as insufficient. “Does that make sense, to hire one company?,” she asked. “There are too many developments.”

Lucille Gant, 77, is an attendee of the NYCHA Castle Hill senior center as well as the president of the center’s advisory board. She says that the computer classes that seniors receive, which take place in their own room with eight personal computers and swivel chairs, were too hot to use during the hottest parts of the summer. “It was a disaster,” she says.

More funding sought

Advocates have been pushing for the release of promised state funds to fix these long-standing breakdowns. On September 26th, a crowd consisting of a few dozen NYCHA residents, along with City Council Speaker Corey Johnson and the nonprofits Community Voices Heard and CAAAV, called on the governor to release the funds.

New York State has earmarked $450 million toward NYCHA in the past few years, but the money has not yet been released. The Cuomo administration says it is waiting for changes to NYCHA’s management structure and are bound by the language in the state budget to do so.

Louis Flores, with the grassroots group Fight For NYCHA, blames the lag in repairs on the city, state, and federal government for failing to fund NYCHA. The group is angry that the U.S. attorney’s office did not require much in the way of new funding beyond $1.2 billion over five years and $2.2 billion over the next decade from the city in its agreement.



They want the governor to disburse his promised funds immediately to an independent body that would use it for emergency repairs. Flores says that rather than wait for a day when federal government fully funds the authority, the city and state should find their own funding now, pointing to the group’s People’s Budget.

“Not having air conditioning in the summer, heat in the winter, this can have adverse effects on people’s health. This should be considered a public health emergency,” Flores says.

It’s not as easy as flipping on the AC

Many residents rely on cooling centers as only half of NYCHA residents have air conditioning systems in their home. NYCHA residents have to get prior approval to install air conditioners and must pay a monthly fee of $8 per unit.

In June, NYCHA began a small pilot program in which it gave some residents new “smart” air conditioners connected to a central air-conditioning system. The program is only underway in one development, Meltzer Towers in Manhattan.

The pilot was one recommendation in a NYCHA study on extreme heat that looked specifically at its effect on seniors. Other recommendations include adding shading to the exterior of some buildings of NYCHA’s senior-only housing. Until more comprehensive improvements can be made, the study found, “providing reliable air conditioning will be a critical intervention to protect NYCHA’s seniors in the short-term.”

There are barriers to installing more ACs: Some residents of NYCHA’s Queensbridge project said that they didn’t use AC’s either because the voltage in their apartment was too low or they didn’t have enough working outlets, according to CAAAV’s Alina Shen.

Pelayo says that after portable AC’s were purchased, DFTA asked the Castle Hill senior Center to be listed as one of the city’s official cooling centers. But Pelayo asked the city not to include them, fearing it would misrepresent the repairs that were still needed.

“That was a band-aid. That wasn’t what they really had to do for me,” she says.

July 2019 was the 10th hottest July in NYC, and the hottest on record globally. According to the Global Change Research program, the average number of heat waves in 50 major American cities has tripled since the 1960s. A 2013 Berkeley study found that non-white people were more likely to live in the hottest part of cities.

NYCHA residents are particularly susceptible to heat. A 2018 report from the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance found that, using the city’s metrics, more than half of NYCHA residents live in the city’s most heat-vulnerable neighborhoods and a NYCHA report found over 70 percent of the city’s senior public housing were in the most heat-vulnerable areas.

At Castle Hill, Pelayo says she’s trying to be cautiously optimistic that NYCHA’s repairs will hold – she says when housing authority often makes repairs, then neglects maintenance for long stretches.

“Hopefully, next summer we won’t have problems,” she says, “We shall see.”",1,climate control is a year round issue at nycha especially for seniors

January 18, 2018

NEW YORK—Mayor Bill de Blasio today announced a $13 million investment to help NYCHA rapidly respond to heating emergencies and replace failing equipment. This funding will replace several boiler systems experiencing chronic outages, secure mobile boilers for emergencies, hire temporary repair staff and seal windows to reduce heat loss. This winter brought the longest stretch of below-freezing days since 1961, straining many NYCHA buildings’ aging heating systems to the breaking point. The new funding will immediately enable the agency to repair equipment faster, and maintain heat under emergency conditions.

“All New Yorkers deserve heat and hot water. While NYCHA has been working around the clock to keep our boilers working, these record cold temperatures are hard on our aging heating systems,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio. “This new investment will help us continue to respond to outages immediately, replace boilers in hardest hit buildings and keep tenants warm.” 

“This investment will address some of our most problematic infrastructure through this recent cold spell and also increase staffing so we can respond to outages faster,” said NYCHA Chair and CEO Shola Olatoye.“This support from Mayor de Blasio will literally keep the heat on in thousands of NYCHA homes and is critical in our efforts to improve service for residents.”

This winter, NYCHA will:

Hire 57 Repair Staff to help respond to boiler outages. This will boost total staff and contracted personnel maintaining boilers from 389 to 446.
Rent 3 Mobile Boilers to have on-hand for heating emergencies. Having this equipment stored on site and ready for immediate deployment will reduce the time needed to restore emergency heat resulting from catastrophic outages from weeks to approximately 24-48 hours.
Seal and Repair 9,600 Windows at NYCHA senior apartments to ensure these windows are properly sealed, keeping heat inside the unit. 
To prepare for next winter, NYCHA will:

Replace 8 boiler plants at Union Avenue and Claremont Houses, two developments with chronic outages.
Install 7 gas-fired, winterized boilers at Patterson, Independence and Pelham Parkway Houses, three developments with recent heating problems. These cleaner, more efficient and more reliable boilers will replace the oil-fired boilers that are experiencing outages.
Buy 5 New Mobile Boilers to have on-hand to provide emergency heat rapidly following major outages.
Since 2014, NYCHA has invested nearly $300 million in heating and plumbing, and has received a $109 million grant from FEMA to replace or repair 67 boilers at 17 developments.

New Energy-Efficient Valves Reduce Energy Usage, Enhance Comfort
by Increasing Resident Control of Temperature

NEW YORK–– The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) has taken advantage of a Con Edison energy-efficiency program to install equipment for managing the temperature in 4,873 apartments – upgrades that help provide comfortable, reliable heat, and reduce demand for energy.

Con Edison’s energy efficiency team installed 16,828 thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) at a cost of $2.17 million. TRVs allow the temperature at each radiator to be adjusted by the resident. Residents often resort to opening windows when their apartments are overheated, which wastes energy and, paradoxically, causes other apartments to experience cold drafts. Now, radiator-by-radiator temperature controls enhance apartment comfort and encourage residents to keep windows closed.

Achieving greater sustainability is one of the main goals of NYCHA’s strategic NextGeneration plan. On Thursday, April 21, the New York City Housing Authority unveiled its Sustainability Agenda, a ten-year roadmap for creating healthy and comfortable housing that will withstand the challenge of climate change – the first time in NYCHA’s history the Authority has developed an integrated plan focused on health, green building and operations, and climate change adaptation and resiliency. This collaborative work with Con Edison is part of NYCHA’s commitment to making energy-efficiency upgrades throughout the portfolio.

“Sustainability is critical to protecting and preserving public housing for future generations,” said NYCHA Chair and CEO Shola Olatoye. “These upgrades will improve quality of life for residents, while making NYCHA more energy-efficient. Shrinking our carbon footprint will help NYCHA and New York City combat the impacts of climate change on our residents.”

In 2015, working with the Mayor’s Office and federal partners at HUD, NYCHA launched a series of large-scale Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs). It is estimated that at least $300 million in work to upgrade and retrofit thousands of buildings will take place through these EPCs by 2025, dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and demand for electricity. These upgrades will also address much-needed capital improvements and reduce NYCHA’s carbon footprint, contributing to Mayor de Blasio’s commitment to reduce New York City’s greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050.

“NYCHA has a history of using our incentives to save energy and make the apartments more comfortable for tenants,” said Phil Madnick, Program Manager for Multifamily Energy-Efficiency Programs at Con Edison. “We have a wide variety of energy efficiency programs to help customers make investments that will lower their energy bills for years to come and help keep New York’s air clean.”

The valves at the NYCHA developments are projected to save 303,257 therms of gas each year, preventing the emission of 1,772 tons of greenhouse gases – the equivalent of taking 338 cars off the road.

The valves have been installed at the following NYCHA developments:
335 East 111th St.
Grampion Houses
First Houses
Smith Houses
St. Nicholas Houses
Carver Houses

NYCHA completes $1 million energy-efficiency upgrades at Howard Avenue Houses in Brooklyn.

Howard Ave. Houses Rendering
NEW YORK — Today, the New York City Housing Authority New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR), and Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee, Inc. (SPRC) announced the completion of a comprehensive, $1 million-dollar energy-efficiency pilot project at Howard Avenue Houses in Brooklyn. This is the first NYCHA development to receive upgrades through the program, which is sponsored by the New York State Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), the largest residential energy conservation program in the country. WAP, which is administered by HCR and funded by the U.S. Departments of Energy and Health and Human Services, assists owners of small homes and multifamily buildings by providing energy-efficiency measures. Howard Avenue received upgrades to lighting, heating and ventilation systems, which will improve the quality of life for NYCHA residents by providing brighter lighting, better air quality, and more consistent heating.

“NYCHA is committed to pursuing every resource available to improve residents’ quality of life,” said NYCHA Chair and CEO Shola Olatoye. “By partnering with New York State Homes and Community Renewal, we can provide better air quality, heating, and lights for our residents and preserve these buildings for the next generation.”

RuthAnne Visnauskas, Commissioner of New York State Homes and Community Renewal said, “People living at NYCHA’s Howard Avenue Houses will soon have safer, healthier and greener homes thanks to this ground-breaking partnership between HCR’s Weatherization Assistance Program, NYCHA, Con Ed, and SPRC. Since 2011, under Governor Cuomo’s leadership, HCR has invested $642.5 million in Weatherization funds throughout New York State, making 116,703 homes more energy efficient. Public housing is one of the most critical affordable housing resources in New York, and I am pleased that with Con Ed and NYCHA’s help, WAP funds will be put to work reducing heating and cooling costs, preserving affordability, and improving quality of life for Howard Avenue House residents.”

“SPRC, Inc. is proud to pioneer this program service on behalf of WAP to NYCHA and its residents,” said Gary Brown, SPRC Executive Director. “While the WAP program benefits the environment and assists to offset the owner investment for upgrades, which in some ‘small home cases’ can be completely free of charge; ultimately, the tenants are the ones who experience the day to day health benefit and realize the monthly savings to their energy bills.”

“As a city, we must do more to reduce our collective energy consumption and protect the environment,” said Brooklyn Borough President Eric L. Adams. “Retrofitting public housing buildings like Howard Avenue Houses is an important step toward expanding energy efficiency techniques across the borough. These kinds of improvements are much needed to lower Brooklyn’s carbon footprint and improve the quality of life for all Brooklynites.”

A recent evaluation of the Weatherization Program conducted by the National Renewable Energy Lab found that this work reduces heating costs by 20% or more in multifamily buildings in New York City, and has positive health benefits for residents. The energy savings resulting from this program will help NYCHA meet its goal to reduce energy intensity by 20 percent by 2025 as part of HUD’s Better Buildings Challenge, and will also contribute to the greenhouse gas emission-reduction goals of the NYC Carbon Challenge and OneNYC.

Since 2015, NYCHA has been working with HCR to bring the benefits of weatherization to the Authority’s smaller, multi-family buildings. Of the Authority’s 326 developments, 160 developments are single stand-alone buildings, low-rise walk-ups, or small multifamily buildings like Howard Avenue Houses.

NYCHA worked with SPRC, one of a series of citywide nonprofit agencies funded to provide WAP services throughout New York City, to make the upgrades at Howard Avenue, which included new windows, new boilers, interior air sleeve covers/draft prevention inserts, Energy Star refrigerators, carbon monoxide and smoke detectors, water-conserving showerheads, new bathroom ventilation fans, energy-efficient LED fixtures and lighting in apartments, common areas, and corridors. The WAP grant provided approximately $760,000 for the project, while Con Edison contributed $31,000 to cover a portion of the lighting installation costs through its Brooklyn-Queens Neighborhood Program.

“NYCHA’s lighting upgrade shows the excellent opportunity our Brooklyn-Queens Neighborhood Program provides for customers in certain areas of the two boroughs,” said Gregory Elcock, Con Edison Manager of the Neighborhood Program. “We’re helping customers make energy efficiency upgrades that will save them money and reduce their bills. Chair Olatoye and her team did great work in making a decision that will benefit NYCHA’s residents and then in working with us on the new lighting.”

“I’m really happy NYCHA did this. We needed it,” said Howard Avenue Resident Association President Rose Clifton. “We got these new windows, new vents in the bathroom, and I really enjoy the lighting they put outside because now you can see everything. Residents are so happy because everything is so much better around here.”

The second development to benefit from this program will be Belmont-Sutter Houses in Brooklyn, which will receive WAP upgrades this summer from SPRC. This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. The Authority is also working with six other WAP providers, who are currently conducting energy audits of 18 developments comprising 2,238 apartments to begin work within the year. NYCHA has pre-qualified 8,000-apartments in total at 46 additional developments for future WAP projects.

The WAP program advances the goals outlined in the NextGeneration NYCHA Sustainability Agenda, which details the Authority’s 10-year commitment to improve resident well-being and operate as an effective and efficient landlord. Since the release of the agenda last year, NYCHA has been working with government and private sector partners to provide better service for residents, reduce energy and costs, and curb the effects of climate change. In addition to the WAP program, work is underway to upgrade heating, hot water, interior and exterior lighting, and ventilation systems in buildings across the city through a series of Energy Performance Contracts (EPCs) and other energy programs.",1,

New heating system upgrades are nearly complete for NYCHA residents living at two Brooklyn developments and one property in Manhattan.  

All new equipment has been installed and is awaiting final testing for boiler replacement projects at Fiorentino Plaza and Long Island Baptist Houses in Brooklyn as well as Robinson Houses in Harlem. All three projects are more than 90 percent complete and are slated to be fully operational in February 2021.   

Each of the three projects involved the replacement of two steam boilers along with associated pumps, piping, and valves. Hot water heat exchangers were replaced with 20, 15, and two gas-fired hot water heaters, respectively, at Fiorentino Plaza, Long Island Baptist, and Robinson Houses. The system upgrades will provide more consistent and comfortable heat for residents. 

Ashley Kebreau of NYCHA’s Capital Projects team noted that this effort was made possible with support from Mayor Bill de Blasio.  

“NYCHA is making efforts towards the city’s 80-percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,” Ms. Kebreau said. “NYCHA staff, along with the supporting design and construction teams, have been working continuously to improve the lives of NYCHA residents. Heat and hot water system upgrades were provided to meet the growing demands and ensure safe, consistent, and efficient energy. The residents at these NYCHA developments will be able to enjoy these upgrades this heating season.”   

This work was supported by a combination of City and federal funds. The $13.3 million Fiorentino Plaza project included approximately $12.5 million in federal funds, while the $7.6 million Robinson project involved $7.1 million in federal funding and the $6.4 million project at Long Island Baptist received $5.9 million in federal funds. 

They are among 10 boiler replacement projects that are expected to be conducted across NYCHA’s portfolio through 2023.

Public housing residents in New York will be receiving efficiency upgrades to their buildings, just not the most needed ones. The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) announced it has secured financing for $103 million worth of heating, lighting and water conservation improvements at 41 developments across New York, including 30 in Brooklyn.

The improvements, however, won’t repair boilers in NYCHA buildings and aren’t intended to cover what a NYCHA spokesperson called “the chronic issues we face during extreme weather situations like we have experienced recently.”

The news comes on the heels of the “bomb cyclone” weather pattern that plunged New York into freezing temperatures in the first week of 2018, leading to thousands of 311 complaints from residents in public housing without heat or hot water.

NYCHA stated that currently, the heating systems at their sites are three-quarters of the way to the end of their useful life and need repairs to perform their normal function. So what will the $103 million be spent on? To monitor and better distribute any heat that is already working.

Many of the housing developments in New York City still run on mid-century heating systems, with outdoor temperature sensors running the buildings’ boiler plants.  The new system will monitor temperatures inside a representative selection of units at each NYCHA site, relaying information to the building management system and mitigating apartment overheating, explained a NYCHA spokesperson.

The modern heating systems will also improve efficiency, and NYCHA predicts the project will result in a 15% reduction in energy costs, which translates to an $8.6 million savings.

The stated goal of the newly announced Energy Performance Contract (EPC) is to allow the city to make costly improvements to its housing infrastructure without sacrificing the capital dollars up-front. Bank of America will provide financing for the project in the form a 20-year loan, which will be repaid through the efficiency savings generated by the project.
The $103 million dollar contracts announced today are part of NYCHA’s NextGeneration Sustainability Agenda, which seeks to invest $300 million into public housing upgrades by 2025, financed through the public-private partnership model of the EPC. The first project, a $56 million efficiency upgrade that ran from April to June of 2017, saw energy-efficient LED light bulbs and water-conserving showerheads installed in NYCHA apartments, along with the replacement of the boiler at Fort Greene’s Whitman Houses.

In the newly-announced phase of the project, more than 16,000 units in 30 Brooklyn developments can expect upgrades of automated heating controls, indoor and outdoor LED lighting, and water conservation measures. Additional boiler replacements, like the one at the Whitman Houses, will not be part of the project’s scope.

The upgrades will begin in March of this year and are to be completed by no later than December 2019.

The investment consists of two smaller EPCs: the $60 million BQDM EPC and the $43 million Sandy-A EPC.

The first is designed to take advantage of the Brooklyn-Queens Demand Management program, a Con Edison incentive program to reduce electrical demands in Brooklyn and Queens. 23 Brooklyn housing developments will be sole beneficiaries of the $60 million investment: Williamsburg, Kingsborough, Brownsville, Van Dyke, Cooper Park, Cypress Hills, Howard, Sumner, Pink, Tilden, Roosevelt, Vernon Avenue, Hughes, Low, Glenmore Plaza, Woodson, Fiorentino Plaza, Unity Plaza and Long Island Baptist.

The Sandy-A EPC of $43 million will be used to expand on work being done to Hurricane Sandy-affected NYCHA sites being repaired with FEMA funds under the NYCHA Sandy Recovery and Resiliency Program. FEMA funding is only used to effect repairs to the level of flooding in a building, explained a NYCHA spokesperson, so the Sandy-A EPC will modernize the building-wide heat distribution systems of the Brooklyn NYCHA developments of Gowanus, Gravesend, Coney Island, Haber and Carey Gardens, along with 11 more sites in Manhattan and Queens.

All of the sites being improved by the Sandy-A EPC are slated to see major Sandy-related repairs to their boilers funded by FEMA, according to the Interactive Sandy Transparency Map. FEMA work at the Gravesend and Carey Gardens sites is still listed as in procurement, while the Coney Island and Haber sites are under construction. The FEMA work is slated to be finished by 2020.",1,103 million nycha heat and efficiency investment wont repair boilers

Volunteering doesn’t have to be a chore. Just ask the more than 230 residents, Property Managers, Caretakers, Superintendents, development office staff, and community partners who spent a few hours on August 6 sprucing up the fences at Van Dyke Houses with a fresh coat of paint.

According to NYCHA Project Manager Helga Nyanffor, residents raised the need for new paint for the fences at Van Dyke’s NextGeneration NYCHA meetings. Collaborative committees had been created to implement the ideas that arose from last year’s NextGen “visioning” workshops, which focused on increasing opportunities and improving the quality of life in the community. Healthfirst wanted to assist with this fence-painting request, and Jacqueline Howard, NYCHA’s Resident Engagement Lead for Van Dyke’s NextGen work, helped bring together all the partners.

“The best part was how different groups that don’t usually work together all joined in,” said Ms. Nyanffor.

It was a beautiful day in Brownsville, Brooklyn, thanks to support from the event’s sponsor, Healthfirst, and assistance from participants like the Van Dyke Resident Association, the NYPD’s Police Service Area 2, Brownsville Jobs-Plus, Brownsville Multi-Service Family Health Center, the NYC Summer Youth Employment Program, Afropunk, and the Brownsville Community Justice Center.

The community voted, and Ravenswood Houses won. The development now has a new basketball court thanks to Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer, Participatory Budgeting, and the youth of the development.

The basketball court was funded through Council Member Van Bramer’s participatory budgeting process, in which a district’s members vote on community improvement projects to be funded by public dollars. The $350,000 basketball court was one of the most popular projects in the 2016 budgeting cycle.

“I am proud to have allocated $350,000 through my Participatory Budgeting initiative to renovate this essential gathering space for the Ravenswood community,” Council Member Van Bramer said. “These new basketball courts will enable residents of all ages to play, exercise, and build community together. I am dedicated to improving quality of life at Ravenswood in every way I can.”

Ravenswood Resident Association President Carol Wilkins applauded the efforts of the young people of Ravenswood. In 2016, Participatory Budgeting voting was open to anyone 14 and older; now, children as young as 11 can vote on projects.

“The children, at the time of voting, got the neighborhood and the community to come together and vote for the court,” Ms. Wilkins said. “Basketball is another outlet for them; it will give them something to do and it’s something the kids worked for, got, and I’m just so glad it’s done.”

Robert White introducing Mayor de Blasio at a September 2017 press conference about combating climate change.
By Onel Hidalgo, Community Outreach Manager, NYCHA’s Office of Recovery and Resilience

Robert White had the type of presence you couldn’t ignore. He would catch your attention the moment he entered a room. Always joyful and energetic – it seemed he never had a bad day. Mr. White applied that same energy and optimism toward his work at NYCHA. As a resident of Red Hook Houses, he took pride in helping his community recover from Superstorm Sandy. He understood what NYCHA residents experienced during Sandy because he lived through it as well.

Mr. White joined NYCHA’s Superstorm Sandy Outreach Team in 2014 and quickly established himself as a leader. He never shied from a task, whether he was asked to help residents temporarily relocate from Sandy-damaged apartments or introduce Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference to announce new standards for greenhouse gas emissions in the city. Mr. White demonstrated time and again that he was always ready for a challenge, even as he attended evening classes to earn his degree in forensic psychology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. His passion and commitment to NYCHA and the Red Hook community served as an inspiration to many on his team. Micaela O’Connell, Community Liaison for NYCHA’s Office of Recovery and Resilience, remembers Mr. White as someone who “honored the dignity of individuals from all walks of life and encouraged everyone to honor their own.”

Mr. White developed lasting friendships wherever he went because he truly cared. He was always willing to listen and lend a helping hand – whether someone needed career advice or film recommendations (he would usually recommend 1980s Eddie Murphy films), Mr. White was always there. His infectious laugh would almost guarantee you walked away with a smile anytime you spoke with him.

During her first year at NYCHA, Chair Shola Olatoye made more than 100 visits with employees at developments and NYCHA offices.
On the first Friday of every month, small groups of employees may be seen waiting outside the Executive Board Room before 8:30 a.m. They may be dressed in suits or jeans, dresses or NYCHA blues. They may work in housing developments or satellite, central, or borough offices. What they have in common is an invitation from Chair and CEO Shola Olatoye to attend a “Coffee with the Chair” meeting.

“The Chair really made me feel welcome,” said Christian Grullon, Assistant Resident Buildings Superintendent at Parkside Houses, part of a group of employees with five to nine years of service. “She came to listen to our needs,not just at our development but at all of NYCHA.”

“It was good to see a broad range of departments and different  perspectives,” said Riva Levine, Social Work Supervisor in Family Services, with employees that had 24 to 30 years of service. “From managers to caretakers, everyone was valued.”

Chair Olatoye’s private meetings with employees began in June 2014 with a small group that had more than 40 years of experience. Since then, the off-the-record monthly meetings over coffee and breakfast pastries have continued with groups of 20 employees randomly selected from all employees in their seniority group. Not all seniority groups have been called yet, which is why the meetings are continuing this year. Eventually, every employee will receive an invitation to participate and the opportunity to be selected.

“I can’t overstate how valuable these meetings are for me as a chance to hear directly from employees about their work experiences and ideas for how we can improve,” Chair Olatoye said. “Our discussions are candid and everyone knows that  anything said is private.

Completed in 2008, the library now contains almost 5,000 books and is visited yearly by approximately 1,200 school children ages 8-15.

Without the assistance of a foundation, patron or other funding source, Mr. Osei has worked to build his dream brick by brick and book by book, visiting Ghana only a few times, most recently last year. “Education is important,” says Mr. Osei. “I want to encourage the children to Housing Assistant Thomas Osei with children in front of a library he raised funds to build in Kumasi, Ghana, so that children could have books and encouragement to succeed in school. (cont. p. 4) stay in school. This is why I’m also sending school supplies, because it is my joy to see these children do well.”

When Mr. Osei visited the library last year, he met with young people now attending technical college with the help and encouragement they received from his project. Mr. Osei now wants to provide more school supplies and books for the library, which has become a vital resource in his hometown. This time, he is reaching out for assistance through a new and popular funding source: crowdsourcing.

Young children often dream of being superheroes like Superman, Batman, or Wonder Woman, but when Mohammed Islam was a child, his superheroes didn’t wear capes, they wore scrubs – they were the doctors and nurses he met accompanying his mother to her medical appointments to act as her translator.

“I was a kid still learning English, hearing medical jargon,” Mr. Islam said. “I saw the doctors and nurses and was intrigued by them. I wanted super powers and they had the power to heal.”

When he was five, Mr. Islam’s family emigrated from Bangladesh to the U.S. to live in East New York, Brooklyn.

He attended the local elementary schools until middle school, when his parents enrolled him in a Queens Madrasa, a school for Islam-centered education, so that he could learn more about his faith and remain focused. It was also post 9/11, and his parents felt that being in a school with other Muslims students would help insulate him from some of the Islamophobia they’d experienced, including instances of someone trying to pull off his mother’s scarf and strangers calling them names.

After his Quran studies at the Madrasa were complete, his teachers advised him to attend a school that trains people to become Islamic scholars. In 2010, he left for Johannesburg, South Africa, for a six-year religious studies program.

When he came back to the U.S. at 21, he felt he was “on a whole new island.” His family had moved from Brooklyn to a larger apartment in Stapleton Houses in Staten Island.

Taking the ferry wasn’t the only thing he had to teach himself to do. He wanted to attend college, but because he didn’t have a high school degree he had to take the high school equivalency exam, which he passed thanks to help from a prep course at Columbia University.

Mr. Islam will be even closer to fulfilling his childhood dream when he graduates from the College of Staten Island this December. He plans to take the Medical College Admission Test in March 2020 and hopes to be accepted to a medical school in New York.

He’s also been preparing for his future career with on-the-job experience. Currently, he works as a scribe at the Staten Island University Hospital ER, where he records notes for attending physicians, completes patient charts, transcribes dictation for medical reports, and more.

And over the summer, he had an amazing opportunity to intern at a teaching hospital in Fez, Morocco, thanks to the Fund for Education Abroad. He spent four weeks at a teaching hospital there, shadowing physicians in nephrology, neurology, pediatrics, and radiation-oncology.

In addition to becoming immersed in Moroccan food, art, language, and “the best tea,” Mr. Islam said the internship “solidified my intention of pursuing a career in medicine and gave me a perspective of what global medicine looks like. I’ve always had the intention of practicing medicine in underserved communities, but I have a global mission now.”

His mission is also to give back on a personal level. Before Morocco, he spent three weeks this summer in the CUNY Service Corps – Puerto Rico, where he helped repair roofs for families whose homes were damaged by Hurricane Maria. He volunteers with Muslims Giving Back, where he teaches a course on the Quran, helps with the organization’s food pantry, and raises money. He was also a member of NYCHA’s Advisory Group on Smoking and Health, which helped implement the Authority’s non-smoking policy.

With all the activities Mr. Islam is involved in, it’s no wonder that he was one of this year’s winners of the NYCHA-CUNY Scholarship, which provides recipients with $1,000 for education-related expenses. In fact, this is the third time he’s won the award.

What keeps him pursuing his goals, even in the face of obstacles, is something he believes everyone, not just superheroes, can live by: “Dream big, and strive with full effort until your dreams become your reality.”",0,nycha cuny scholar 2

A play written and performed by members of NYCHA’s Sumner Senior Center in Brooklyn showcased the wealth of knowledge and life lessons to be learned from older adults, and how sharing that knowledge enriches both the lives of seniors and their communities.

“Making a Difference in Our Daily Lives” was written and performed by Aline Dubose, Martha Jackson, Elizabeth Lloyd, Jannie Monroe, Janice Murphy, Bessie Prince, Rachel Smith, and Crystal Todd, and directed by Marissa Metelica. Viewings of the play were held on two dates in June to packed audiences.

The play, based on the authors’ lives, was a window into a monthly meeting of a women’s group called “A Light of a New Day.” Over lemonade, the women talked about their youth, marriage and relationships, child rearing, education, and self-empowerment. There were heavy topics, including domestic violence and elder safety, but there were also stories of resilience and self-determination: being business owners, graduating from college, the joy brought by their children and grandchildren.

Audience members laughed, applauded, and gave the women words of encouragement throughout the performance.

Sumner Senior Center playFor these women, most of whom had no theater or acting experience, the workshop was a chance to share their lives and work with their peers. Elizabeth Lloyd said she felt relieved to share her story publicly. Rachel Smith said she and her co-authors “really enjoyed just being ourselves.” Martha Jackson said she will never forget this experience because “it makes you feel better to let it out – the more you talk about it, the better; there’s nothing better than telling the truth from our own experiences.”

From January through June, the women worked with Marissa Metelica, a theater artist and social justice educator, to draft and rehearse their play. Ms. Metelica said she used storytelling games to help pull material from their lives and figured out common themes to help the women develop the play.

Inspired by watching her friend Jannie Monroe walk her dog in the mornings, Bessie Prince wrote the opening of the play, which dealt with issues the women face as seniors. “I wanted to talk about the condition of the world today, seniors being careful, ladies being careful,” Ms. Prince said. “It took on another life when all the ladies got together telling stories, sharing their lives. There’s humor, but there’s also a lot of sadness. These ladies are here to say they went through it and they’re here to talk about it now.”

The workshop was made possible through the SU-CASA community arts initiative, a program of the Brooklyn Arts Councilthat connects older adults with artists to work on art projects.

“I’m very proud and excited to share this play,” Ms. Metelica said. “There were not enough seats for the folks who wanted to see the show. The work that’s being done here at this center is worthwhile, and we need to keep supporting them and this community.” Ms. Metelica and the women hope to perform the play at other senior centers to raise awareness about the importance of senior centers to their communities.",0,reminiscing through theatre

Keynote Speaker David Ushery at NYCHA’s Black History Month
Celebration.
On February 19, NYCHA hosted its 48th annual Black History Celebration in the Ceremonial  Room at 90 Church Street.

This year’s theme – “A Century of Black Life, History and Culture” – was introduced by Community Operations Bronx Borough Director Marlon Forbes, who noted that NYCHA has its own Black history to celebrate, including the appointment of NYCHA’s Chair Shola Olatoye, the second African American woman to hold that role.

Before introducing the evening’s keynote speaker, David Ushery, Chair and CEO Olatoye remarked that Dr. Martin Luther King once said, “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’ At NYCHA we are building on the legacies of great Black Americans who’ve shaped our lives to make life better for the next generation of NYCHA residents.”

An Emmy-winning NBC 4 news anchor, Mr. Ushery discussed the contributions of Black Americans and the challenges still to be faced.

“NYCHA is an important part of the fabric of this city and I want to honor you for the work [that] you do on behalf of NYCHA residents. Great Black Americans are a part of NYCHA’s history: Frederick Douglass, Ursula Burns, Carmelo Anthony, and even Whoopi Goldberg,” Mr. Ushery  noted.

The elegant event, attended by over 100 employees, featured a delicious soul food buffet and music by the Yaffa All Stars, a jazz trio.

“I really appreciate the opportunity to honor Black Americans and to meet colleagues that I rarely have a chance to see out in the field,” said Robin Reed, Property Manager at Segwick Houses.

NYCHA’s Haitian American Employee Association, NAACP branch, and Nigerian Employee Organization staffed tables loaded with information, including a luscious Haitian pumpkin pie recipe.

“This is the kind of event you just can’t miss,” said Nathaniel Williams Jr., Supervisor of Caretakers at Abraham Lincoln Houses, who celebrated his 36th anniversary with NYCHA on February 20. “This event is important for all of us at NYCHA.”",0,nycha celebrates black history

A new mural series at the Lillian Wald Senior Center vividly showcases the rich history and culture of immigrants who shaped the Lower East Side and continue to shape the community.

Unveiled on July 10, “Roots/Raíces” is a series of five colorful murals on 1,200 square feet of the center’s exterior walls. The mural project was led by Thrive Collective, a non-profit organization that creates hope and opportunity through arts, sports, and mentoring. The organization held workshops with older adults at the senior center in March and April to develop the concept, content, and designs of the mural.

The murals were painted in June, with the help of more than 100 volunteers, including seniors, young people, and other community members. In addition, artists from two non-profits in Puerto Rico, Ciudad Museo PR and Project Refugee PR, contributed their artistic skills and talents. Fermin Mendoza, a teaching artist with Thrive Collective, led the concept and design workshops with seniors and the mural production.

The five murals are named Alphabet City, Capicu, Coquí, Flor de Maga, and Piraguas. They include colorful depictions of community members playing dominoes and pool, dancing, laughing, enjoying piraguas (Puerto Rican shaved ice), and memories of ancestral homes. One mural includes a portrait of Henry Street Settlement founder Lillian Wald, who the senior center and development are named for.

“Roots/Raíces” was funded by a grant that Thrive Collective received from Council Member Carlina Rivera and SU-CASA/New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, with support from The United Jewish Council of the East Side, which runs the Lillian Wald Senior Center.

Deputy General Counsel Sam Mordi describes NYCHA’s rent and fees collection process at a January 12 training session at 90 Church Street. The Law and Management Services Departments coordinated a total of six training sessions for almost 700 Operations employees.
Deputy General Counsel Sam Mordi describes NYCHA’s rent and fees collection process at a January 12 training session at 90 Church Street. The Law and Management Services Departments coordinated a total of six training sessions for almost 700 Operations employees.
The first two weeks of the new year began with training for property managers, assistant property managers and housing assistants across NYCHA for one of the most important and sometimes sensitive jobs—collecting the rent. NYCHA’s Rent Collection Initiative is a key part of NextGeneration NYCHA, as rent and related fees provide about one third of the Authority’s operating budget. NextGen NYCHA calls for increasing revenue through rent collection by $10 million annually.

“How we measure the rent collection rate for each development has been simplified, effective January 1, so that the result of the Rent Collection Initiative can be properly assessed,” said Accounting and Fiscal Services Department Deputy Director Adham Choucri, who explained new metrics and reports at the start of the training session held on January 12. Each development will be assigned a target rent collection rate, based on its prior performance.

Operations managers and supervisors are learning more about the new reports and expectations for accountability at monthly borough meetings, which the Queens/Staten Island Property Management Departments has already completed.

“Rent Demand”
Rent collection begins with asking for it! But like all steps in the rent collection process, there are carefully prescribed methods and procedures, with forms to record each step in the process. The “rent demand” may be made in person, by phone, or in writing, explained Sam Mordi, NYCHA’s Deputy General Counsel, who conducted the training. “You have to show tenants respect and then they will respect you. It goes both ways,” he noted.

However, if rent is not paid by the 15th day of the month, and the resident owes two or more months’ rent, a Petition and Notice of Petition must be legally served. If a proper rent demand cannot be demonstrated by documentary evidence, Mr. Mordi warned, any case for nonpayment that NYCHA may bring to Housing Court could be dismissed.

Rental Assistance Referrals
Although eviction for unpaid rent is an outcome that NYCHA and the City want to avoid, the training included detailed information regarding Housing Court proceedings also contained in a new manual recently compiled by the Law Department and distributed at the training sessions. Training also included important information on rent assistance referrals and emergency assistance grants that can help families in arrears.

NYCHA has entered into an agreement with the Human Resources Administration (HRA) to provide emergency assistance grants to residents facing eviction for non-payment of rent or chronic rent delinquency. To facilitate this process, NYCHA is now placing a 35-day hold on evictions for these cases.

Property management staff also learned about community- based organizations that provide residents with financial counseling, financial literacy workshops and other means for financial self-sufficiency. Most residents pay their rent on time and when they are delinquent on rent they are usually faced with other, more complex issues causing loss of income.

“Operations staff have a wealth of knowledge to share,” Mr. Mordi later said. “They are always willing to learn new tools and procedures that will assist them in collecting the rent. The comprehensive Housing Court Proceedings Manual developed by the Law Department with assistance from Operations and other departments represents a major effort that will provide another valuable resource.”

Housing Assistant Denise Parker at Jefferson Houses in Manhattan said, “even though I have been with NYCHA for 29 years, I gained more knowledge about how to handle certain cases in Housing Court and I was also glad to learn that we can contact our Law Department for assistance.”

“It’s good that the training emphasized new ways to help tenants,” said Assistant Property Manager Dorcas Perdue at Carey Gardens in Brooklyn, “like contacting the Social Services Department in HRA or community agencies. We never want to see families lose their homes for not paying rent.”",0,rent collection training provides staff with new tools and insights
