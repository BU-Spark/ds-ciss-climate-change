Celebrating Hispanic Heritage
Every year from September 15 to October 15, National Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated to acknowledge the contributions made to America by Hispanic people and Americans with ancestry from Spanish-speaking countries. To commemorate the month, The NYCHA Journal is highlighting the Authority’s developments named after prominent Hispanic people.

We have a right to be first-class Americans with all the prerogatives of a free country.”
